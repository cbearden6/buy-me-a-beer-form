                <img class="beer" src="images/lafindumonde.jpg" alt="photo of me drinking la fin du monde">
                <p>Thanks for the beer, Bigazzdolphin!
                    This hearty 9% ABV Belgian style triple ale was brewed in Chambly, Canada and developed in the
                    Middle Ages by Trappist monks. They intended it to be drank on special occasions, but I’m taking it
                    to pound town on a balmy Thursday night. This beast is mildly yeasty with notes of malt, fruit, and
                    spice. Followed by a dry finish.
                </p>

                <h2>CHIMAY - CINQ CENTS WHITE TRIPEL- 8% ABV</h2>
                <img class="beer" src="images/chimay.jpg" alt="photo of me drinking chimay">
                <p>Thanks for the beer, Spyder! This ale was brewed within the walls of an existing Trappist monastery
                    under the control of the Trappist community in Baileux, Belgium. A major part of this beer’s sales
                    revenue is used by the monks to support their charitable works. Since 1862, Chimay’s secondary
                    fermented ales have neither been pasteurized nor filtered and only natural ingredients are used.
                    Getting drunk for a good cause...sounds great to me!</p>

                <img class="beer" src="images/asahi.jpg" alt="photo of me drinking asahi">
                <p>Thanks again, Spyder! This super dry Japanese beer is intended to be drank during all seasons
                    and was brewed in
                    Toronto, Canada. You’ve probably drank your fair share of this stuff if you frequent sushi joints.
                    It’s a real spot hitter.</p>

                <p>Thanks for the beer, Katie! Here it is, folks. The mother of all IPAs. It’s one of my all-time
                    favorites at least. Brewed locally in good ol’ Seattle, WA. The aroma is subtle pine and citrus, and
                    it tastes like it smells. This is the real deal.</p>

                <img class="beer" src="images/frambois.jpg" alt="photo of me drinking frambois">
                <p>Thanks again, Katie! This stuff is great. Do you like raspberries? Do you like beer? If so, you’ll
                    love this stuff. This tasty nectar has been brewed for six generations by Lindeman’s in Vlezenbeek,
                    Belgium. Its rich, sweet raspberry flavor and character will knock your socks off.</p>
